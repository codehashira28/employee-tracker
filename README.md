# employee-tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a project that combines the inquirer and mysql2 npm packages to create a way to interact with a company employee database in the Node.js environment. Through the inquirer prompts, the user can select from a variety of actions to perform queries, updates, and additions to a pre-populated employee database.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once the command 'node index.js' is ran in the CLI, the user is presented with a prompt to pick from a number of different actions that will interact with the employee database. There are options to view, update, and add to the employee database which will proceed with follow up prompts depending on the action chosen. Once the actions are performed, the user can select any 'view' actions to see their changes made.
